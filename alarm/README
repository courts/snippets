== Introduction ==

"alarm" is a simple command line script to add a new message which should pop
up at a certain time to a remind file. I'm starting remind with the following
command line in my Window Manager's (XMonad) startup script:

remind -z '-k zenity --info --text="%s" &' ~/.alarm_reminders

This puts remind in 'daemon' mode, periodically checking the file
~/.alarm_reminders for new entries. It will then run Zenity to pop up a
message box at due time.

Messages can either have an absolute or relative time. Examples:

- 10:00 My Message
- 10s My Message
- 30m My Message
- 1h My Message


== Example ==

Writing

alarm '30m Dinner is ready'

on Dec 27, 2009 at 12:00 o'clock will add the entry

REM Dec 27 2009 AT 12:30 MSG %3 %"dinner is ready%"%
